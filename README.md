## v0 – Initial Implementation

This version represents the initial working implementation where:
- Cura plugin logic
- Geometry processing
- Packetization
- UDP communication

were handled within a single module.

While functionally correct, this version had tight coupling between UI, domain logic, and hardware interfaces, making testing and extensibility difficult.

This version is preserved to document the architectural evolution of the system.
